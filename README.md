Multi-part/Multi-day Lab</br>
Every great captain, whether on the waters or in the skies, keeps a daily log.</br>

Let's build the perfect Captain's Log App for our extraordinary captains.

There are many ways to get started building an app. This lab follows a specific order for two reasons:

to align with the content of lecture</br>
to give you an order to guide you to create small bits of functionality and test each one before moving on to the next part</br>

Set up</br>
Let's keep track of our Restful Routes as we build out our app. Copy/paste this table into a fresh file, open an excel/sheets spreadsheet or draw on a piece of paper. Feel free to add more columns and notes to help you put it all together.</br>

Index, New and Create has been completed for you.
